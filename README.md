 1. A FEW CHALLENGES I ENCOUNTERED. SOME OUT OF SHEER CARELESSNESS BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO. NEWER HEROKU PROCESSES USE git push heroku main and not git push heroku master.
 2. ANOTHER PITFALL THAT ALMOST HAD ME,I WOULD GIT ADD ALL MY FILES EVEN THE VENV AND GIT WOULD GO HAYWIRE. SO, I CREATED A .gitignore FILE AND ADDED .env INSIDE THE     FOLDER SO THAT EVEN WHEN I STAGE ALL MY FILES ON GIT,IT WILL ALWAYS IGNORE MY VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT(VENV) FILE.
 3. ENSURE YOUR PROCFILE IS WELL SPELLED. IF NOT HEROKU WILL KEEP THROWING YOU ERRORS EVERYTIME YOU TRY TO RUN A DYNO. SPELLING IS Procfile. ONLY THE 'P' IS CAPITAL
